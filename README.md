# CryptoRepresentation

A program to visualize some basic cryptographic algorithms.

User through the program can get familiarized with 3 basic cryptographic algorithms: Caesar Cipher, One Time Pad Cipher and Vigenere Cipher. In this version of the program user can choose the cipher he wants and encrypt / decrypt as many messages as he wants. There is also the ability to visualize the process of each cipher.

Design limitations of current version:
  - Caesar Cipher is designed with an ecryption parameter of three.
  - One Time Pad Cipher is designed to generate a random key each time the corresponding frames opens.
  - Vigenere Cipher has the word "come" as a key prefix.
